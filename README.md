csvtoArray
==========

Convert a csv from an URL into an array and iterate through it.
<p> This is actually just a minor adaptation from something I found in StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7431268/how-read-data-from-csv-file-using-javascript and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14654168/csv-import-script-not-functioning-in-google-spreadsheets) and should not be considered my work, but something I used to work a bit on.<p>
Remeber to include always a header in your spreadsheet, as the code will automatically jump the first row.
