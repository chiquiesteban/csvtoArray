csvtoArray
==========

Convert a csv from an URL into an array and iterate through it.
<p> This is actually just a minor adaptation from something I found in StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7431268/how-read-data-from-csv-file-using-javascript) and should not be considered my work. Just something I wanted to keep.
